    <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Collecting a high-quality dataset is a critical task that demands meticulous attention
to detail, as overlooking certain aspects can render the entire dataset unusable.
Autonomous driving challenges remain a prominent area of research, requiring
further exploration to enhance the perception and planning performance of vehicles.
However, existing datasets are often incomplete. For instance, datasets that include
perception information generally lack planning data, while planning datasets typi-
cally consist of extensive driving sequences where the ego vehicle predominantly
drives forward, offering limited behavioral diversity. The CARLA Leaderboard 2.0
challenge, providing a diverse set of scenarios to address the long-tail problem in
autonomous driving, has emerged as a valuable alternative platform for developing
perception and planning models. Nevertheless, existing datasets collected on this
platform present certain limitations. Some datasets appear to be tailored primarily
for limited sensor configuration, with particular sensor configurations. Additionally,
in some datasets, the expert policies used for data collection exhibit suboptimal
driving behaviors, such as oscillations. To support end-to-end autonomous driving
research, we have collected a new dataset comprising over 2.85 million frames
using the CARLA simulation environment for the diverse Leaderboard 2.0 chal-
lenge scenarios, making it the largest dataset in the literature to the best of our
knowledge. Our dataset is designed not only for planning tasks but also supports
dynamic object detection, lane divider detection, centerline detection, traffic light
recognition, and prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate its versatility by
training various models using our dataset..</p>
